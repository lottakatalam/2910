# Simple Spring Boot REST API

This repo contains a simple Java Spring Boot REST API. There is one endpoint called /person where to query from and send data to. It is not fully functional and the code also contains some TODO-comments to showcase, what should be done for further development. Techonogies used in this Gradle-project are Java 8 and Spring Boot with some extensions and the unit tests are created with Junit5. 

# Smallest gap

This is a small function made with Java 8 to contribute to the part 2 of the assignment.
